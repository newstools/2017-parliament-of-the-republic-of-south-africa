Parliament, Wednesday, 21 November 2017 – Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry today adopted the redrafted National Gambling Amendment Bill. Committee Chairperson, Ms Joanmariae Fubbs, said although the Department of Trade and Industry had introduced a comprehensive Bill, the committee had resolved to deal with three technical issues only to address existing governance challenges speedily. These issues were the reconfiguration of the National Gambling Board to the National Gambling Regulator, addressing governance challenges relating to the National Gambling Policy Council and broadening the National Central Electronic Monitoring System. Ms Fubbs further stated that other more substantive issues, such as horse racing, dog racing, electronic bingo terminals, betting on lottery results and online gaming, have been noted and is being referred for consideration in the sixth Parliament. ”Even though the committee considers these matters to be serious, the time available would not have allowed for an effective interrogation of these matters. Therefore, the committee is of the view that these amendments, adopted today, will pave the way for more comprehensive and holistic amendments to the gambling regulatory framework,” said Ms Fubbs.
